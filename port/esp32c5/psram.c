/*
 * ESP32-C5 PSRAM bring-up and verification.
 *
 * The part on this board is a C5HR8: 16 MB in-package flash, 8 MB in-package
 * PSRAM. The PSRAM half of that has never been enabled in this port - the
 * bootloader was built with `# CONFIG_SPIRAM is not set`, so nothing has ever
 * talked to it.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * What this file adds, and why it is not just "turn CONFIG_SPIRAM on".
 *
 * CONFIG_SPIRAM + CONFIG_SPIRAM_BOOT_INIT make the IDF startup code call
 * esp_psram_init() before the RT-Thread kernel starts, and until that call
 * succeeds there is no way to tell "the config is wrong" from "this board has no
 * PSRAM" from "the PSRAM is there and the timing is wrong" - the startup path
 * only logs. So this exposes the same calls as a command that reports each step:
 *
 *   c5psram          - state: chip init ok?, reported size, heap region size
 *   c5psram test     - allocate from PSRAM and write/read back a pattern
 *
 * The two error paths are distinguished on purpose: esp_psram_chip_init()
 * failing means the chip did not answer (not fitted, or the wrong mode/speed);
 * succeeding but with a size of 0 means it answered but was mapped at zero
 * length.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Interaction with RT-Thread's own heap.
 *
 * RT-Thread keeps its own allocator on top of a fixed region
 * (CONFIG_IDF_RTTHREAD_HEAP_SIZE) and does not know about IDF's heap. PSRAM is
 * added to IDF's heap_caps allocator by esp_psram_init(), so
 *
 *   - `rt_malloc()` will NOT return PSRAM, ever, and
 *   - `heap_caps_malloc(size, MALLOC_CAP_SPIRAM)` is the way in.
 *
 * Bridging the two is a real decision, not a detail: pointing RT-Thread's small
 * allocator at an external SPI-backed region changes the cost of every
 * allocation in the system, and its bitmaps live in the region they manage. That
 * is left alone here deliberately - this brings the memory up and proves it
 * works, and says plainly that nothing is using it yet.
