/*
 * ESP32-C5 RMT (Remote Control Transceiver): TX, as a plain C API.
 *
 * RT-Thread has no RMT class, so like PCNT and MCPWM this is an API plus an msh
 * command rather than an rt_device.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * How this is verified with no external instrument.
 *
 * A transmitted waveform is only "correct" if something counts its edges. The
 * RMT's own RX channel can do that: channel 0 transmits a square wave and
 * channel 2 (the C5's first RX channel) receives it on the same pad, because
 * RMT_SIG_OUT0 and RMT_SIG_IN0 are separate matrix indices that can be pointed
 * at one pin. The received symbols then give the pulse count and widths, which
 * is a real measurement of what left the transmitter rather than a read-back of
 * the registers that were written.
 *
 * What is NOT verified and is stated as such: the analog shape of the pulses,
 * and anything about the pad drivers themselves - the loop is inside the GPIO
 * matrix, so nothing leaves the chip.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * C5 specifics, versus the S31 file this was ported from:
 *
 *  - TWO TX and TWO RX channels, not four and four. `soc_rmt_signals[0]` gives
 *    ch0/ch1 as TX (RMT_SIG_OUT0/1) and ch2/ch3 as RX (RMT_SIG_IN0/1), with the
 *    TX entries carrying `rx_sig = -1` and vice versa. A driver that assumes
 *    every channel can do both writes a channel that silently does nothing.
 *
 *  - The symbol memory is at RMTMEM (0x60006400, from esp32c5.peripherals.ld),
 *    48 words per channel. IDF writes it directly rather than through the APB
 *    FIFO, which avoids all FIFO bookkeeping. The struct is re-declared here so
 *    this file does not depend on esp_driver_rmt, which this port does not link.
 *
 *  - `sys_conf.apb_fifo_mask` must be set to 1 before addressing the array:
 *    with the reset value (0) an APB store into the RMTMEM window pushes the
 *    FIFO instead, every symbol reads back as zero, and the transmitter keeps
 *    sending whatever the array already held. IDF sets the same bit in
 *    rmt_hal_init().
 *
 *  - The memory array has its own low-power domain and defaults to low power.
 *    `rmt_ll_mem_force_power_on()` is required; the bus clock alone does not
 *    power it, and without it every write lands in a dead array.
 *
 *  - The carrier generator is ON out of reset (`chnconf1.carrier_en_chn` reads
 *    back 1). Left on, every symbol is modulated by the carrier: the frame's
 *    total duration is right but the transitions per symbol jump from 1 to ~32,
 *    which looks like a timing bug and is not one.
