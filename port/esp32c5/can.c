/*
 * TWAI as an RT-Thread `rt_can` device (`can0`).
 *
 * The register path has been proven since round 12 (搂17f): self-test + internal
 * loopback, a frame out and back at 125k/250k/500k/1M, with the bit timing
 * checked against the decoded BTR rather than assumed. What was deliberately left
 * out then was the device class, on the grounds that a class on top of an unproven
 * register sequence only makes failures harder to see. The register sequence is
 * proven, so this adds the class.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * What this file is, and what it is not.
 *
 * It is a thin adapter: `rt_can`'s ops table over the functions in twai.c. It
 * does NOT re-implement anything about the controller, and it does not change
 * how twai.c brings it up. `c5twai` still passes because the register path is
 * untouched.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The two things that are not obvious:
 *
 * 1. `rt_can`'s interrupt-driven RX path needs a real interrupt. `rt_hw_can_isr()`
 *    can only be called from one. So the device is registered with
 *    ESP_INTR_FLAG_LEVEL1 through `esp_intr_alloc`, exactly the way gpio.c does it
 *    (搂17b's note: a hardcoded line number collides with the OS tick, which is
 *    how that round lost a console).
 *
 * 2. `sendmsg` is expected to hand the frame to the hardware and return; the
 *    completion is reported later through `rt_hw_can_isr()`. This driver's
 *    controller has one TX buffer per `rt_can` mailbox and the twai.c send path
 *    already waits for a free one, so `sendmsg` returns RT_EOK once the frame is
 *    armed - which is what the contract asks for.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Verification, and it is the same loopback as 搂17f behind the device class:
 *
 *   open `can0`  ->  configure 500 kbit/s  ->  write an rt_can_msg
 *                ->  read the same id/len/data back  ->  compare
 *
 * If the class is wired correctly the frame comes back through the framework
 * rather than through twai.c's own function, which is the whole point of adding
 * it. What that does NOT prove is the analog layer - still no transceiver, still
 * no second node.

 * until buffer 0 is left in TX_OK and the send path starts using buffer 1.
 *
 * Measured consequence: the second `c5can` in one boot returned 0 bytes from
