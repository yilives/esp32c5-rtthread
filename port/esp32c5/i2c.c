/*
 * ESP32-C5 I2C master: rt_i2c_bus_device_ops over the I2C LL.
 *
 * Same reasoning as the UART, GPIO and PWM drivers in this directory:
 * esp_driver_i2c sits on FreeRTOS primitives (xQueue for its command queue,
 * xQueueSendFromISR in its ISR), so driving the LL directly is smaller and
 * auditable. Everything below touches registers only.
 *
 * Ported from port/esp32s31/i2c.c. Four things differ on this chip and each of
 * them is a silent failure if carried over unchanged:
 *
 * 1. THERE IS ONE HP I2C INSTANCE, NOT TWO. SOC_HP_I2C_NUM is 1 on the C5;
 *    SOC_I2C_NUM is 2 because it counts the LP controller, which has a separate
 *    register block (LP_I2C) and is out of scope here. The S31 file indexes two
 *    HP buses and would read `&I2C1`, which does not exist on this target -
 *    I2C_LL_GET_HW() maps port 1 to &LP_I2C.
 *
 * 2. THE CLOCK SOURCE IS SELECTED THROUGH PCR, AND DEFAULTS TO XTAL. The S31
 *    gates I2C through HP_SYS_CLKRST with its own divider. Here
 *    i2c_ll_set_source_clk() writes PCR.i2c[0].i2c_sclk_conf.i2c_sclk_sel, and
 *    the choice is XTAL (0) or RC_FAST (1). XTAL is used for the same reason as
 *    everywhere else in this port: it is exact, so the bus rate does not move
 *    when DFS changes the CPU frequency. The divider has to be computed from
 *    that same source, which is why esp_clk_xtal_freq() is read at run time -
 *    CONFIG_XTAL_FREQ is 0 on this board (CONFIG_XTAL_FREQ_AUTO).
 *
 * 3. THE INTERRUPT STATUS BITS ARE AT DIFFERENT POSITIONS. On the S31 this file
 *    tested bit 1 for NACK and bit 5 for timeout. On the C5 those are
 *    txfifo_wm_int_st and arbitration_lost_int_st; NACK is bit 10 and the two
 *    timeouts are bits 13 and 14. Testing the S31 masks here would report a
 *    NACK whenever the TX FIFO watermark fired. The struct field names are used
 *    instead of magic numbers so the positions cannot drift again.
 *
 * 4. THE PAD SIGNALS COME FROM A TABLE, NOT FROM io_mux_reg.h. The S31 file
 *    takes I2C0_SCL_PAD_OUT_IDX from soc/gpio_sig_map.h; on the C5 those names
 *    do not exist and the indices live in i2c_periph_signal[], whose HP entry
 *    is I2CEXT0_{SCL,SDA}_{IN,OUT}_IDX.
